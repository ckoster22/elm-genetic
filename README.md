# A Genetic Algorithm written in Elm

## Concepts

A **Genetic Algorithm** is an algorithm that can find a *good enough* solution to an optimization problem. More on that [here](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/genetic-algorithms?utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=videos_homepage&utm_campaign=videos_row1).

The core of the algorithm contains a lot of boilerplate and this package aims to hide that boilerplate so that you can instead focus on solving problems with your genetic algorithm.
